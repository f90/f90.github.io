Hello World!

My name is Daniel Stoller and I am currently doing my PhD in the context of a PhD programme called Media and Arts Technology at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL). In addition to my interest in technology, which led me to obtain a Bachelor and Master degree in Computer Science, I am very passionate about music â€“ be it listening, playing the drums, or singing. Out of this passion grew an urge to understand the phenomenon of music from a scientific point of view. As a result, I am conducting research in the field of music informatics, attempting to unravel the intricacies of music using methods from computer science.

Enjoy and feel free to comment my blog posts or contact me directly.

Daniel
