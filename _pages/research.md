My research covers both machine learning and music information retrieval (MIR). Broadly speaking, I am interested in

* Unsupervised learning: How can we leverage unlabelled data to improve generalization in MIR tasks?
* Multi-task learning: How can we solve multiple related MIR tasks in one model, to increase parameter efficiency and generalization?
* Bayesian machine learning, which helps us build model priors and transfer knowledge between tasks
